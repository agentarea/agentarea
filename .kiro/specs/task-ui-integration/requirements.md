# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing task management UI by replacing mock data with real backend integration, adding missing functionality for task monitoring, and improving the user experience. The current implementation has a basic task table and detail view but uses mock data and lacks real-time updates, proper error handling, and advanced features like filtering and metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real task data instead of mock data in the tasks table, so that I can monitor actual agent task execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tasks page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display actual tasks from the getAllTasks API
2. WHEN there are no tasks THEN the system SHALL display the existing empty state with proper messaging
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with retry functionality
4. WHEN tasks are loading THEN the system SHALL show the existing loading spinner
5. WHEN I click on a task THEN the system SHALL navigate to the task detail page using the real task ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real task details and execution information, so that I can understand what my tasks are actually doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a task detail page THEN the system SHALL fetch real task data using the task status API
2. WHEN viewing task details THEN the system SHALL display actual execution status from Temporal workflows
3. WHEN a task has execution logs THEN the system SHALL display them in the logs tab
4. WHEN a task has performance metrics THEN the system SHALL show them in the metrics tab
5. WHEN task data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control task execution (pause, resume, cancel), so that I can manage task workflows as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is running THEN the system SHALL show pause and cancel buttons
2. WHEN a task is paused THEN the system SHALL show resume and cancel buttons
3. WHEN I click pause THEN the system SHALL pause the Temporal workflow and update the task status
4. WHEN I click resume THEN the system SHALL resume the paused workflow
5. WHEN I click cancel THEN the system SHALL terminate the workflow completely
6. WHEN control operations succeed THEN the system SHALL show success feedback and update the task status
7. WHEN control operations fail THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
8. WHEN I attempt destructive actions THEN the system SHALL show confirmation dialogs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and search tasks, so that I can find specific tasks quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the search input THEN the system SHALL filter tasks by description or agent name
2. WHEN I select a status filter THEN the system SHALL show only tasks with that status
3. WHEN I apply filters THEN the system SHALL update the displayed task list immediately
4. WHEN I clear filters THEN the system SHALL show all tasks again
5. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state in the URL

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see task execution logs, so that I can debug issues and understand task behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing task details THEN the system SHALL provide a logs tab with execution logs
2. WHEN logs are available THEN the system SHALL display them with timestamps and log levels
3. WHEN logs are extensive THEN the system SHALL implement scrolling or pagination
4. WHEN viewing logs THEN the system SHALL highlight different log levels with colors
5. WHEN I want to export logs THEN the system SHALL provide a download option

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see task performance metrics, so that I can understand resource usage and execution efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing task details THEN the system SHALL display execution time and basic metrics
2. WHEN metrics are available THEN the system SHALL show them in a dedicated metrics tab
3. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL display data in a readable format
4. WHEN metrics include charts THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visualizations
5. WHEN I want to export metrics THEN the system SHALL provide download functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive feedback about task status changes, so that I can stay informed about task progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the new status
2. WHEN a task fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the failure in the task list
3. WHEN I perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
5. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL show success confirmations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the task interface to work well on different devices, so that I can manage tasks from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the existing responsive layout SHALL work properly
2. WHEN loading many tasks THEN the system SHALL handle large datasets efficiently
3. WHEN the interface updates THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance
4. WHEN network is slow THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
5. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
