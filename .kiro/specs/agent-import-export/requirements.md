# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to export agents along with their associated tools and configurations to YAML format, and import them back into the system. This functionality supports agent portability, backup/restore operations, sharing between environments, and marketplace distribution. The YAML format provides human-readable configuration that can be version controlled and easily modified.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to export an agent with all its tools and configurations to a YAML file, so that I can backup, share, or migrate agents between environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an export request is made for an agent THEN the system SHALL generate a YAML file containing the agent definition, all associated tools, MCP server configurations, and metadata
2. WHEN exporting an agent THEN the system SHALL include agent properties such as name, description, system prompt, model configuration, and execution settings
3. WHEN exporting an agent THEN the system SHALL include all MCP tools associated with the agent including server connection details and tool specifications
4. WHEN exporting an agent THEN the system SHALL include version information and export timestamp for tracking purposes
5. IF the agent has dependencies on external resources THEN the system SHALL document these dependencies in the export file
6. WHEN the export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide the YAML file for download or save it to a specified location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to import an agent from a YAML file, so that I can restore backups, deploy shared agents, or migrate agents from other environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a YAML import file is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure before processing
2. WHEN importing an agent THEN the system SHALL create the agent with all properties specified in the YAML file
3. WHEN importing an agent THEN the system SHALL configure all MCP tools and server connections as defined in the import file
4. IF MCP servers referenced in the import don't exist THEN the system SHALL either create them or provide clear error messages about missing dependencies
5. WHEN importing an agent with a name that already exists THEN the system SHALL provide options to overwrite, rename, or cancel the import
6. WHEN the import is successful THEN the system SHALL return the created agent ID and confirm all tools are properly configured
7. IF the import fails validation THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to programmatically export and import agents via API endpoints, so that I can automate agent deployment and management workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling the export API endpoint THEN the system SHALL return the agent YAML as a downloadable response
2. WHEN calling the import API endpoint with YAML content THEN the system SHALL process the import and return success/failure status
3. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL support both file upload and direct YAML content submission for imports
4. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL provide detailed response messages including validation errors and success confirmations
5. WHEN exporting via API THEN the system SHALL support query parameters to control what components are included in the export

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the YAML format to be human-readable and well-documented, so that I can manually edit configurations and understand the agent structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating YAML exports THEN the system SHALL use clear, descriptive field names and logical structure
2. WHEN generating YAML exports THEN the system SHALL include inline comments explaining complex configurations
3. WHEN generating YAML exports THEN the system SHALL follow consistent formatting and indentation standards
4. WHEN generating YAML exports THEN the system SHALL organize related configurations into logical sections
5. WHEN validating YAML imports THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages that reference specific lines and fields

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to export/import agents through the web interface, so that I can easily manage agents without using command-line tools or APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an agent in the web interface THEN the system SHALL provide an "Export" button that downloads the YAML file
2. WHEN on the agents management page THEN the system SHALL provide an "Import Agent" option that accepts YAML file uploads
3. WHEN importing through the web interface THEN the system SHALL show a preview of what will be imported before confirmation
4. WHEN import validation fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages in the web interface
5. WHEN import succeeds THEN the system SHALL redirect to the newly created agent's detail page

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want sensitive information to be handled appropriately during export/import, so that credentials and secrets are not exposed inappropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting an agent THEN the system SHALL exclude actual secret values and instead include placeholders or references
2. WHEN exporting an agent THEN the system SHALL document which secrets need to be configured after import
3. WHEN importing an agent THEN the system SHALL validate that required secrets are available or prompt for them
4. WHEN handling secrets during import THEN the system SHALL use the existing secrets management system (Infisical integration)
5. IF exported YAML contains sensitive data THEN the system SHALL warn the user and provide options to sanitize the export
