# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current task management system has evolved organically and now contains significant duplication across multiple service classes. We need to refactor the task services to establish a clean, hierarchical architecture with proper separation of concerns. The goal is to create a unified task service architecture that eliminates duplication while maintaining flexibility for different execution backends.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean task service hierarchy so that I can easily understand and maintain the task management code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the task service code THEN there SHALL be a clear abstract base class that defines the core task service interface
2. WHEN implementing task services THEN they SHALL extend the abstract base class to ensure consistent behavior
3. WHEN adding new task service implementations THEN they SHALL follow the established inheritance pattern
4. IF a task service needs specialized behavior THEN it SHALL override specific methods while maintaining the base contract

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate code duplication between task services so that maintenance is simplified and bugs are reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining task service implementations THEN there SHALL be no duplicate method implementations across services
2. WHEN common functionality exists THEN it SHALL be implemented in the base class
3. WHEN specialized behavior is needed THEN it SHALL be implemented through method overrides or composition
4. IF multiple services share similar logic THEN that logic SHALL be extracted to shared utilities or base methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the task service to handle internal task operations while keeping A2A protocol concerns separate so that the architecture remains clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the task service processes tasks THEN it SHALL handle internal task lifecycle management
2. WHEN A2A protocol operations are needed THEN they SHALL be handled by separate adapter classes
3. WHEN task execution occurs THEN the core service SHALL delegate to appropriate execution managers
4. IF protocol-specific behavior is required THEN it SHALL be implemented in dedicated protocol adapters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified task model and consistent interfaces so that different parts of the system can work together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task services operate on tasks THEN they SHALL use a consistent task model
2. WHEN different services interact THEN they SHALL use compatible interfaces
3. WHEN task data is persisted THEN it SHALL use a unified repository pattern
4. IF task models need to be extended THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection and testability so that the task services can be easily tested and configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task services are instantiated THEN they SHALL receive dependencies through constructor injection
2. WHEN testing task services THEN dependencies SHALL be easily mockable
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN task service implementations SHALL be swappable
4. IF new execution backends are added THEN they SHALL integrate through the existing interfaces
