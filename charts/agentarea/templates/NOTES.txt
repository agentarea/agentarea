This umbrella chart deploys the complete AgentArea platform including:

1. Backend API Service (agentarea-backend)
2. Frontend Service (agentarea-frontend)
3. Database Service (Bitnami PostgreSQL)
4. Redis Service (Bitnami Redis)
5. Worker Service (agentarea-worker)
6. MCP Manager Service (agentarea-mcp-manager)
7. Secrets Manager Service (agentarea-secrets-manager)
8. Temporal Service (agentarea-temporal)

Each component is managed by its own subchart with independent configurations.

To access the application, you'll need to create an Ingress or use port forwarding:

  $ kubectl port-forward service/agentarea-frontend 3000:3000

Then visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

For production deployments, consider:
1. Setting up proper Ingress with TLS
2. Configuring persistent storage for the database
3. Setting up proper resource limits and requests
4. Configuring health checks and monitoring
