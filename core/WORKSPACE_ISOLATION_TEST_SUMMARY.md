# Comprehensive Workspace Isolation Test Suite

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite created for workspace isolation functionality as specified in task 15 of the user-workspace-system spec.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests for WorkspaceScopedRepository Functionality
**File:** `tests/unit/test_workspace_scoped_repository_comprehensive.py`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Auto-population of workspace_id and created_by fields during creation
- ✅ Workspace filtering in get_by_id operations
- ✅ Creator-scoped vs workspace-scoped filtering
- ✅ List operations with workspace isolation
- ✅ Count operations with workspace filtering
- ✅ Update operations with workspace verification
- ✅ Delete operations with workspace verification
- ✅ Error handling for missing records
- ✅ Custom query methods maintaining isolation
- ✅ Filter generation and validation

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Repository operations automatically inject workspace context
- Cross-workspace access returns None (not errors)
- Creator-scoped operations only affect user's own records
- Workspace-scoped operations affect all workspace records
- Immutable fields (created_by, workspace_id) cannot be modified

### 2. JWT Token Extraction and Validation Tests
**File:** `tests/unit/test_jwt_token_extraction_comprehensive.py`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Valid JWT token extraction and context creation
- ✅ Missing authorization header error handling
- ✅ Malformed authorization header error handling
- ✅ Invalid JWT token error handling
- ✅ Expired token error handling
- ✅ Wrong secret key error handling
- ✅ Missing required claims (sub, workspace_id) error handling
- ✅ Empty required claims error handling
- ✅ Optional claims handling (email, roles)
- ✅ Different JWT algorithms support
- ✅ Test utility functions for JWT generation

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- JWT tokens must contain 'sub' and 'workspace_id' claims
- Invalid tokens result in 401 Unauthorized responses
- Missing claims result in 400 Bad Request responses
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Test utilities support various token scenarios

### 3. Workspace Error Handling Tests
**File:** `tests/unit/test_workspace_error_handling.py`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ JWT authentication error scenarios
- ✅ Repository operation error handling
- ✅ Cross-workspace access error prevention
- ✅ Database error propagation
- ✅ Invalid input handling
- ✅ Error message security (no information leakage)
- ✅ Context validation errors

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Authentication errors return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Cross-workspace access fails gracefully (returns None/False)
- Database errors are properly propagated
- Error messages include workspace context but no sensitive data
- Invalid inputs are handled gracefully

### 4. Integration Tests for Workspace Data Isolation
**File:** `tests/integration/test_workspace_data_isolation.py`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Complete workspace isolation between different workspaces
- ✅ Creator-scoped vs workspace-scoped filtering behavior
- ✅ Custom repository methods maintaining isolation
- ✅ Update and delete operations with workspace verification
- ✅ Repository factory pattern with workspace context
- ✅ Large dataset handling with pagination
- ✅ Edge cases and error scenarios

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Multiple users in same workspace see all workspace data
- Users in different workspaces see no cross-workspace data
- Creator-scoped operations only affect user's own records
- Custom repository methods respect workspace boundaries
- Pagination maintains workspace isolation

### 5. Cross-Workspace Access Prevention Tests
**File:** `tests/integration/test_cross_workspace_access_prevention.py`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Complete isolation between enterprise tenants
- ✅ Government classified vs public workspace isolation
- ✅ Startup vs enterprise workspace isolation
- ✅ Malicious actor access prevention
- ✅ Cross-workspace update prevention
- ✅ Cross-workspace delete prevention
- ✅ Search and filter isolation
- ✅ Count and exists operation isolation
- ✅ Admin user workspace boundary enforcement
- ✅ Same user in different workspaces isolation
- ✅ Stress testing with concurrent operations
- ✅ Complex query isolation
- ✅ Pagination isolation

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Enterprise A cannot access Enterprise B data
- Government classified data isolated from public data
- Malicious actors cannot access any legitimate workspace data
- Admin users cannot cross workspace boundaries
- Same user in different workspaces has isolated data
- High-load scenarios maintain isolation

### 6. Comprehensive Integration Tests
**File:** `tests/integration/test_workspace_isolation_comprehensive.py`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ End-to-end JWT to repository isolation
- ✅ Multi-tenant enterprise isolation
- ✅ Government security level isolation
- ✅ Repository factory comprehensive isolation
- ✅ High-load concurrent operation isolation
- ✅ Complex query and filtering isolation
- ✅ Data integrity across operations

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Complete flow from JWT token to database operations
- Multiple enterprise tenants with complete isolation
- Government agencies with security level separation
- Repository factory maintains isolation across all operations
- System maintains isolation under high concurrent load
- Complex business logic queries respect workspace boundaries

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Utilities Created:
- **JWT Test Utilities:** Generate test tokens with various claims and scenarios
- **Mock Models:** Test models implementing WorkspaceScopedMixin
- **Test Repositories:** Custom repositories for testing workspace isolation
- **Context Fixtures:** Various user and workspace contexts for testing
- **Database Fixtures:** In-memory SQLite databases for integration tests

### Test Runner:
- **`test_workspace_isolation_suite.py`:** Comprehensive test runner that executes all workspace isolation tests and provides detailed reporting

## Requirements Compliance

This test suite addresses all requirements specified in task 15:

### ✅ Requirement 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 - Workspace Data Isolation
- Tests verify that agents, tasks, triggers, and MCP instances are isolated by workspace
- Cross-workspace access is prevented at the repository level
- All operations automatically filter by workspace_id

### ✅ Requirement 3.5 - Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling tests for invalid workspace access
- Tests verify appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Key Features Tested

1. **Automatic Context Injection:** All repository operations automatically inject user and workspace context
2. **Workspace-Scoped Operations:** Default behavior returns all workspace resources (not just user's)
3. **Creator-Scoped Operations:** Optional filtering to only user's own resources
4. **Cross-Workspace Prevention:** Complete prevention of cross-workspace data access
5. **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid access attempts
6. **JWT Integration:** Full integration from JWT token to database operations
7. **Repository Factory:** Dependency injection pattern maintains workspace context
8. **Performance:** System maintains isolation under high load

## Test Execution
