# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AgentArea currently has inconsistent workspace_id and created_by fields across different models without proper data isolation and filtering. This feature will implement consistent workspace_id and created_by handling throughout the system to enable multi-tenant data isolation using JWT tokens for user and workspace context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent workspace_id and created_by context extraction from JWT tokens, so that all API endpoints automatically have access to the current user and workspace information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL extract user_id and workspace_id from JWT token claims
2. WHEN JWT token is valid THEN the system SHALL inject user_id and workspace_id into the request context
3. WHEN JWT token is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
4. WHEN JWT token lacks required claims THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with specific error message
5. WHEN context extraction succeeds THEN the system SHALL make workspace_id and created_by available to all services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want workspace-level data isolation, so that my organization's data is completely separated from other organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying agents THEN the system SHALL only return agents belonging to the current workspace_id
2. WHEN querying tasks THEN the system SHALL only return tasks belonging to the current workspace_id
3. WHEN querying triggers THEN the system SHALL only return triggers belonging to the current workspace_id
4. WHEN querying MCP server instances THEN the system SHALL only return instances belonging to the current workspace_id
5. WHEN creating any resource THEN the system SHALL automatically set the workspace_id to the current workspace

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want all database models to consistently include workspace_id and created_by fields, so that data isolation is enforced at the database level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating any new record THEN the system SHALL automatically populate workspace_id and created_by fields from JWT context
2. WHEN updating existing records THEN the system SHALL verify the record belongs to the current workspace
3. WHEN deleting records THEN the system SHALL verify the record belongs to the current workspace
4. WHEN querying records THEN the system SHALL automatically add workspace_id filter to all queries
5. IF a record is accessed from the wrong workspace THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 Not Found

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a service developer, I want repository-level filtering, so that all data access automatically respects workspace boundaries without manual filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository methods are called THEN the system SHALL automatically inject workspace_id filters
2. WHEN creating records through repositories THEN the system SHALL automatically set workspace_id and created_by from context
3. WHEN repository base classes are used THEN the system SHALL provide workspace filtering by default
4. WHEN custom queries are needed THEN the system SHALL provide helper methods for workspace filtering
5. IF workspace context is missing THEN repository methods SHALL raise a context error exception

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to clean up existing data, so that all records have proper workspace_id and created_by or are removed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup migration runs THEN the system SHALL delete all records lacking workspace_id or created_by
2. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL add NOT NULL constraints to workspace_id and created_by fields
3. WHEN cleanup encounters foreign key constraints THEN the system SHALL delete dependent records first
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL log the number of records deleted per table
5. IF cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and log detailed error information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want consistent audit logging, so that all user actions are tracked with proper user and workspace context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any resource is created THEN the system SHALL log the action with created_by and workspace_id
2. WHEN any resource is updated THEN the system SHALL log the change with created_by and workspace_id
3. WHEN any resource is deleted THEN the system SHALL log the deletion with created_by and workspace_id
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them with created_by and workspace_id context
5. WHEN audit logs are queried THEN the system SHALL support filtering by created_by and workspace_id

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want workspace context in API responses, so that the UI can display workspace-specific information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include current workspace_id in response headers
2. WHEN listing resources THEN the system SHALL include workspace metadata in responses
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL include workspace context in error responses
4. WHEN JWT token is refreshed THEN the system SHALL maintain workspace context consistency
5. IF workspace context changes THEN the system SHALL return updated workspace information in headers
