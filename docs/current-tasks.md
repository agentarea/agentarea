# AgentArea Development Tasks

## 🎯 Current Status

**✅ COMPLETED: Unified MCP Architecture Implementation**

The major architectural refactoring has been completed successfully:
- ✅ Removed `provider_type` field - logic now determined by mcp-infrastructure based on `json_spec` content
- ✅ Implemented unified `json_spec` field for all configuration (similar to Airbyte connectors)
- ✅ Renamed `server_id` to `server_spec_id`
- ✅ Cleaned up outdated integration services and event bridge components

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- ✅ Architecture is now clean and follows event-driven patterns
- ✅ MCP Infrastructure handles all deployment logic automatically  
- ✅ AgentArea focuses on data management and user interface
- 🚧 API alignment in progress (see next actions)

## 🎯 Next Actions Plan

### 1. API Analysis & Alignment
Analyze API definitions in `core/agentarea_api/api/v1/` to identify correct endpoints & payload schemas for:
- LLM model specifications & instances
- MCP server specifications & instances  
- Agent creation
- Task creation

### 2. E2E Test Updates
Update `core/comprehensive_e2e_test.py` to align with the current API:
- ✅ Use trailing slashes on collection endpoints to avoid redirect issues
- 🔄 Correct paths for MCP server **instances** (`/mcp-server-instances/`)
- 🔄 Adjust payload fields for MCP server specification (now requires `docker_image_url`, `version`, `tags`, etc.)
- 🔄 Adapt MCP server instance payload to match `json_spec` schema
- 🔄 Modify agent-creation payload to use the new schema (`instruction`, `model_id`, `tools_config`)
- 🔄 Update task creation step to new REST payload (`message`, `agent_id`, optional `user_id`)
- ✅ Simplify success checks to the new responses (HTTP 201 + JSON `id`)

### 3. Route Cleanup
Remove duplicate `/tasks` routes to prevent clashes:
- 🔄 Delete the `/tasks` and `/tasks/stream` endpoints defined in `core/agentarea_api/api/v1/chat.py` – these duplicate the dedicated `tasks.py` router

### 4. Testing & Validation
- 🔄 Run the test suite locally to ensure the updated E2E test passes
- 🔄 Verify API startup has no route collisions
- 🔄 Test MCP server instance creation flow end-to-end

### 5. Commit Strategy
Commit changes as two logical commits:
- "refactor: align comprehensive E2E test with current API"
- "chore: remove duplicate /tasks endpoints from chat router"
