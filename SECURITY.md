## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AgentArea seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@agentarea.ai**

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress. If you have not received a response to your email within 48 hours, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

### Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of coordinated disclosure:

1. **Report received**: We acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. **Initial assessment**: We assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
3. **Fix development**: We work on a fix (timeline depends on complexity)
4. **Fix testing**: We thoroughly test the fix
5. **Release**: We release the fix and publish a security advisory
6. **Public disclosure**: After users have had time to update (typically 7-14 days)

### Scope

The following are considered in scope for security reports:

- **AgentArea Core API**: Authentication, authorization, data validation
- **MCP Server Management**: Server isolation, privilege escalation
- **Agent Execution**: Code injection, sandbox escapes
- **Data Storage**: SQL injection, data leakage
- **Frontend**: XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass
- **Infrastructure**: Container escapes, secrets exposure

### Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Denial of service attacks
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Issues in third-party dependencies (please report to the respective maintainers)
- Issues requiring physical access to the server
- Issues in development/testing environments

### Security Best Practices

When deploying AgentArea, please follow these security best practices:

#### Production Deployment

- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Use strong, unique passwords and API keys
- Enable audit logging
- Regularly backup your data
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implement rate limiting
- Use container security scanning

#### Environment Configuration

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or secret management systems
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
- Use least-privilege access principles
- Enable database encryption at rest
- Configure proper network segmentation

#### MCP Server Security

- Run MCP servers in isolated containers
- Use read-only file systems where possible
- Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, network)
- Validate all inputs from MCP servers
- Use secure communication channels
- Regularly audit MCP server permissions

### Security Features

AgentArea includes several built-in security features:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all actions
- **Secrets Management**: Integration with external secret management systems
- **Container Security**: Secure container configurations and isolation

### Vulnerability Disclosure

When we release security fixes, we will:

1. Publish a security advisory on GitHub
2. Update our documentation with security recommendations
3. Notify users through our communication channels
4. Credit the reporter (if desired) in our security advisory

### Bug Bounty Program

We are currently evaluating the implementation of a bug bounty program. Please check back for updates or contact us at security@agentarea.ai for more information.
