"""AgentArea Execution Library

LangGraph-based Temporal workflow execution for agent tasks.

Core Components:
- Models: Data models for agent task execution
- Activities: Atomic agent execution activities (focused on LLM and tool execution)
- Interfaces: Service container for AgentArea service injection
- TemporalFlow: Custom ADK flow that routes LLM calls through Temporal activities
- TemporalLlmAgent: LlmAgent that uses TemporalFlow for execution
- Workflows: LangGraph-based workflows that orchestrate activities
- LLM Integration: Direct LiteLLM integration for model execution
- MCP Integration: Tool execution via MCP server instances
- Agent Management: Agent configuration and state management

The library provides a clean separation between:
- Workflows (orchestration logic)
- Activities (atomic operations)
- Services (business logic from other libraries)

This architecture allows for:
- Easy testing and mocking
- Clean dependency injection
- Scalable workflow execution
- Integration with existing AgentArea services
