# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add missing repository methods to TaskRepository

  - Add get_by_agent_id method to TaskRepository (currently called but missing)
  - Add get_by_user_id method to TaskRepository (currently called but missing)
  - Add get_by_status method to TaskRepository (currently called but missing)
  - Add update_status method for atomic status updates
  - Write tests for new repository methods
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Enhance SimpleTask model with additional fields

  - Add missing fields to SimpleTask model (started_at, completed_at, execution_id, metadata)
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing SimpleTask usage
  - Update task model validation to handle new fields
  - Write tests for enhanced SimpleTask model
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Create BaseTaskService abstract class

  - Create new abstract base class in `core/libs/tasks/agentarea_tasks/domain/base_service.py`
  - Implement common CRUD operations (create_task, get_task, update_task, list_tasks, delete_task)
  - Add protected validation and event publishing methods
  - Define abstract submit_task method for subclasses to implement
  - Write unit tests for BaseTaskService common functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 4. Refactor main TaskService to extend BaseTaskService

  - Modify existing TaskService to inherit from BaseTaskService
  - Remove duplicate CRUD methods that are now inherited from base class
  - Keep specialized methods like submit_task, cancel_task, execute_task
  - Update constructor to call super().**init**() properly
  - Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 5.1_

- [x] 5. Remove duplicate TaskService from application layer

  - Delete `core/libs/tasks/agentarea_tasks/application/service.py`
  - Update any imports that reference the duplicate service
  - Migrate any unique functionality from duplicate service to main TaskService
  - Update dependency injection configuration to use unified service
  - Ensure no functionality is lost during removal
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 6. Fix dependency injection configuration issues

  - Fix the broken get_task_service() function in deps/services.py that has incorrect async/await usage
  - Update get_task_repository() to properly handle async session dependency
  - Ensure TaskService can be properly instantiated with all required dependencies
  - Test that dependency injection works correctly in API endpoints
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 7. A2A protocol adapter already implemented

  - The A2ATaskBridge class already exists and handles protocol separation
  - It converts between A2A tasks and internal SimpleTask model
  - It delegates to TaskService for actual task management
  - Protocol concerns are properly separated from core service logic
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and validation

  - Implement custom exception classes (TaskValidationError, AgentNotFoundError, etc.)
  - Add proper validation in BaseTaskService protected methods
  - Ensure error handling flows work correctly across service hierarchy
  - Add error event publishing for failed operations
  - Write tests for error scenarios and exception handling
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4_

- [x] 9. Update existing tests to work with refactored architecture

  - Update TaskService tests to work with new inheritance structure
  - Add tests for BaseTaskService abstract functionality
  - Update mock objects and fixtures for new service structure
  - Ensure test coverage is maintained or improved
  - Add integration tests for service interactions
  - _Requirements: 5.2_

- [x] 10. Verify API compatibility and update documentation
  - Test that all existing API endpoints work with refactored services
  - Update any service documentation to reflect new architecture
  - Verify that no breaking changes were introduced
  - Update dependency injection documentation
  - Create migration guide for developers using the services
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 5.4_
