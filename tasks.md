# AgentArea Development Tasks

## 🎯 Current Status
**✅ COMPLETED: Unified MCP Architecture Implementation**

The major architectural refactoring has been completed successfully:
- Removed `provider_type` field - logic now determined by mcp-infrastructure based on `json_spec` content
- Implemented unified `json_spec` field for all configuration (similar to Airbyte connectors)
- Renamed `server_id` to `server_spec_id`
- Cleaned up outdated integration services and event bridge components
