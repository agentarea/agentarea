# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol implementation will enable AI agents to communicate and collaborate with each other through standardized messaging and task delegation. This feature builds upon the existing task orchestration system and Temporal workflows to provide seamless inter-agent communication capabilities within the AgentArea platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agents to be able to communicate with other agents, so that I can build complex multi-agent workflows where agents can delegate tasks and share information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent needs to communicate with another agent THEN the system SHALL provide a standardized A2A protocol interface
2. WHEN an agent sends a message to another agent THEN the system SHALL route the message through the existing event system
3. WHEN an agent receives an A2A message THEN the system SHALL deliver it through the SDK's event handling mechanism
4. IF an agent is not available THEN the system SHALL queue the message for later delivery
5. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL maintain message ordering and delivery guarantees

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want A2A communications to be secure and auditable, so that I can ensure proper access control and track inter-agent interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL enforce authentication and authorization
2. WHEN an A2A message is sent THEN the system SHALL log the interaction with sender, receiver, and message metadata
3. WHEN an agent attempts to communicate with another agent THEN the system SHALL verify the sender has permission to contact the target agent
4. IF an unauthorized communication attempt occurs THEN the system SHALL reject the message and log the security event

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an agent developer, I want to use simple SDK methods for A2A communication, so that I can easily integrate inter-agent communication into my agent logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing an agent THEN the SDK SHALL provide intuitive methods for sending messages to other agents
2. WHEN an agent receives a message THEN the SDK SHALL provide event handlers for processing incoming A2A communications
3. WHEN sending a message THEN the SDK SHALL support both synchronous request-response and asynchronous messaging patterns
4. WHEN handling A2A events THEN the SDK SHALL provide access to message metadata including sender identity and timestamp

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want A2A protocol to integrate seamlessly with Temporal workflows, so that agent communications can be part of reliable, long-running business processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an A2A communication occurs within a Temporal workflow THEN the system SHALL maintain workflow state consistency
2. WHEN an agent delegates a task to another agent THEN the system SHALL create appropriate Temporal activities for tracking
3. WHEN an A2A communication fails THEN the system SHALL support Temporal's retry and error handling mechanisms
4. WHEN workflows involve multiple agents THEN the system SHALL coordinate their execution through Temporal's orchestration capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor and debug A2A communications, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize multi-agent workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN A2A communications occur THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring through the existing dashboard
2. WHEN debugging agent interactions THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of message flows and timing
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL track A2A communication latency and success rates
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide correlation IDs to trace messages across agent boundaries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an agent, I want to discover and communicate with other available agents, so that I can dynamically build collaborative workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent needs to find other agents THEN the system SHALL provide agent discovery capabilities
2. WHEN querying for agents THEN the system SHALL return agent metadata including capabilities and availability status
3. WHEN an agent becomes available or unavailable THEN the system SHALL update the agent registry accordingly
4. WHEN establishing communication THEN the system SHALL provide agent capability matching to find suitable collaborators
