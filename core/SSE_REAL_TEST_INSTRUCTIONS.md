# 🧪 Real SSE UI Test Instructions

## ✅ Setup Complete

The real SSE test environment is ready! A beautiful HTML test interface has been created to test the real-time event streaming with the actual AgentArea API.

## 🌐 Test Interface

The test page (`test_real_sse.html`) should now be open in your browser. If not, open it manually:
```bash
open test_real_sse.html
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Available Agent
- **Agent ID**: `0f6923dd-621f-482d-8908-a5315393abc4`
- **Name**: klk
- **Status**: active

### API Settings
- **API URL**: `http://localhost:8000` (already configured)
- **Agent ID**: Use `0f6923dd-621f-482d-8908-a5315393abc4` or the provided one

## 🎯 How to Test

1. **Open the Test Page**: The HTML file should be open in your browser
2. **Configure Settings**: 
   - API URL should be `http://localhost:8000`
   - Agent ID should be `0f6923dd-621f-482d-8908-a5315393abc4`
3. **Create a Test Task**:
   - Enter a task description (e.g., "Write a story about AI agents")
   - Click **"Create Task & Start Streaming"**
4. **Watch Real-Time Events**:
   - The page will automatically connect to the SSE stream
   - You'll see real-time events as the workflow executes
   - Events are color-coded by type (Workflow, LLM, Budget, Tool, System)

## 📊 What You'll See

### Event Types
- **🔄 Workflow Events**: WorkflowStarted, WorkflowStepStarted, WorkflowCompleted
- **🧠 LLM Events**: WorkflowLLMCallStarted, WorkflowLLMCallCompleted
- **💰 Budget Events**: WorkflowBudgetWarning, WorkflowBudgetExceeded  
- **🔧 Tool Events**: WorkflowToolCallStarted, WorkflowToolCallCompleted
- **⚙️ System Events**: Connected, heartbeat, task_status_changed

### Real-Time Statistics
- Total events received
- Breakdown by event category
- Live event feed with timestamps
- Event data in JSON format

## 🚀 Features of the Test UI

### ✅ Real-Time Event Streaming
- Uses native browser EventSource API
- Connects to actual AgentArea SSE endpoint
- Shows real workflow events as they happen

### ✅ Beautiful Interface
- Color-coded events by type
- Real-time statistics dashboard
- JSON data display for each event
- Connection status indicators

### ✅ Interactive Testing
- Create tasks directly from the UI
- Real-time connection management
- Clear events and statistics
- Error handling and display

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Connection Status
- Green: Connected and receiving events
- Yellow: Connecting/attempting connection  
- Red: Disconnected or error

### Common Issues
1. **API not running**: Make sure `make run-api` is running
2. **Wrong Agent ID**: Use the provided agent ID from curl output
3. **CORS issues**: The API should allow localhost connections
4. **Network errors**: Check browser developer console for details

## 📝 What This Tests

1. **SSE Endpoint**: `/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/tasks/{task_id}/events/stream`
2. **Task Creation**: POST to `/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/tasks`
3. **Real-Time Events**: Actual workflow events from Temporal workflows
4. **Event Formatting**: Proper SSE format with event types and data
5. **Connection Management**: Heartbeats, reconnection, error handling

## 🎉 Expected Results

When working correctly, you should see:
1. Task creation confirmation
2. SSE connection established 
3. Real-time workflow events streaming in
4. Events like:
   - `connected` - Initial connection
   - `WorkflowStarted` - Workflow begins
   - `WorkflowLLMCallStarted` - LLM call begins
   - `WorkflowLLMCallCompleted` - LLM call finishes
   - `WorkflowCompleted` - Workflow finishes
   - `heartbeat` - Periodic keepalive

This proves the real-time SSE streaming implementation is working end-to-end with the actual UI and API! 🚀
