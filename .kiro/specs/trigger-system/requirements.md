# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The trigger system enables automated agent execution based on scheduled events and external webhooks. The system supports two primary trigger types: cron-based scheduled triggers that run agents at specific times (daily, weekly, etc.), and webhook triggers that respond to incoming HTTP requests from external services. This creates an automation layer that allows agents to run on schedules or react to external events without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to define triggers that automatically execute agent tasks when specific events occur, so that I can create automated workflows and responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a trigger THEN the system SHALL store the trigger configuration with event criteria and response actions
2. WHEN a trigger is created THEN the system SHALL validate that the specified agent exists and the event type is supported
3. WHEN a trigger is created THEN the system SHALL allow specifying conditions and filters for when the trigger should activate
4. IF a trigger configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the trigger creation with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want triggers to automatically execute when matching events occur, so that automated workflows can run without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a system event occurs THEN the system SHALL evaluate all active triggers to determine matches
2. WHEN a trigger matches an event THEN the system SHALL execute the configured action (create agent task)
3. WHEN a trigger executes THEN the system SHALL pass relevant event data as task parameters to the agent
4. IF multiple triggers match the same event THEN the system SHALL execute all matching triggers independently
5. WHEN a trigger execution fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other triggers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage trigger lifecycle (enable/disable/delete), so that I can control automated behaviors and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator disables a trigger THEN the system SHALL stop evaluating that trigger for new events
2. WHEN an administrator enables a disabled trigger THEN the system SHALL resume evaluating that trigger for new events
3. WHEN an administrator deletes a trigger THEN the system SHALL remove it permanently and stop all evaluations
4. WHEN an administrator updates a trigger THEN the system SHALL apply the new configuration to future event evaluations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to monitor trigger executions and their results, so that I can understand automated workflow behavior and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trigger executes THEN the system SHALL record execution details including timestamp, event data, and result
2. WHEN a trigger execution completes THEN the system SHALL store the created task ID and execution status
3. WHEN a user queries trigger history THEN the system SHALL return paginated execution records with filtering options
4. WHEN a trigger execution fails THEN the system SHALL record the error details for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to create cron-based scheduled triggers, so that agents can run automatically at specific times or intervals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a cron trigger THEN the system SHALL accept standard cron expressions for scheduling
2. WHEN a cron trigger is created THEN the system SHALL validate the cron expression syntax
3. WHEN a scheduled time arrives THEN the system SHALL execute the configured agent task
4. WHEN a cron trigger executes THEN the system SHALL pass the current timestamp and schedule information as task parameters
5. IF a cron expression is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the trigger creation with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to create webhook-based triggers, so that agents can respond to external HTTP requests and integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a webhook trigger THEN the system SHALL generate a unique webhook URL for receiving HTTP requests
2. WHEN a webhook trigger is created THEN the system SHALL allow specifying HTTP method filters (GET, POST, etc.)
3. WHEN an HTTP request is received at a webhook URL THEN the system SHALL execute the configured agent task
4. WHEN a webhook trigger executes THEN the system SHALL pass the HTTP request data (headers, body, query params) as task parameters
5. WHEN a webhook request is processed THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate HTTP response to the caller

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to support predefined webhook integrations for common services, so that setting up integrations with external platforms is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a webhook trigger THEN the system SHALL support specifying a webhook type for common services (telegram, slack, github, etc.)
2. WHEN a predefined webhook type is specified THEN the system SHALL automatically apply appropriate request parsing and validation logic
3. WHEN a predefined webhook receives a request THEN the system SHALL extract relevant data according to the service's webhook format
4. WHEN a predefined webhook trigger executes THEN the system SHALL pass service-specific parsed data as task parameters
5. IF a predefined webhook type is not recognized THEN the system SHALL treat it as a generic webhook and process accordingly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure trigger parameters and conditions, so that I can customize how and when triggers execute.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a trigger THEN the system SHALL allow specifying custom task parameters to pass to the agent
2. WHEN creating a trigger THEN the system SHALL allow specifying conditions for when the trigger should execute
3. WHEN creating a webhook trigger THEN the system SHALL allow specifying request validation rules (required headers, body format)
4. WHEN creating a cron trigger THEN the system SHALL allow specifying timezone settings for schedule execution
5. IF trigger conditions are not met THEN the system SHALL not execute the agent task and log the reason

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to prevent excessive trigger executions and system abuse, so that the platform remains stable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trigger executes THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent excessive executions
2. WHEN a webhook trigger receives too many requests THEN the system SHALL apply rate limiting per webhook URL
3. WHEN a trigger fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL automatically disable it after a configurable threshold
4. WHEN a trigger creates a task THEN the system SHALL mark the task with trigger metadata for tracking and debugging
5. IF a trigger execution takes too long THEN the system SHALL timeout and log an error
